# IBM-AI-Engineering-Course-Final-Project

AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning: In the final course of the 6 course series, learners apply their deep learning knowledge and expertise to a real world challenge. We use a library of our choice to develop and test a deep learning model. In my case it's PyTorch. We will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.

Learning Outcomes:

 * determine what kind of deep learning method to use in which situation
 * know how to build a deep learning model to solve a real problem
 * master the process of creating a deep learning pipeline
 * apply knowledge of deep learning to improve models using real data
 * demonstrate ability to present and communicate outcomes of deep learning projects
